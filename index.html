I dug through the data and pulled out the most interesting insights, which paint a picture of optimistic professionals who have taken control of their own destiny. This could be in part because the organizations who sponsored the study — The Freelancers Union and the freelancer marketplace Upwork — have a vested interest in making freelancing look good. So take these numbers with a grain of salt.",

It's difficult to grasp the concept of one person being in control of a billion dollars-a billion dollars!-even in the later stages of a fantastic career. But someone in their thirties? Or even twenties? It's not though, and we can't write the world's youngest billionaires off as merely lucky or just born into the right family, either. Some of them definitely had a little of column A and a bit of column B, but you can lose a billion dollars as quickly as you can lose $100 if luck is all you have going for you.",
